# Twig-to-jsx
Converts a `.twig`Â file into a JSX ready syntax.
It is not to be used at runtime to transpile an existing .twig into a React component as of the current release (altough that'd be very cool to try!). It really is intended as a helper tool for devs converting legacy .twig files into a JSX component.

## Setup
`TODO`

## Output dependancies
The outputed file will make use of the `jsx-control-statements` npm package (look them up!) since it makes for an easier direct translation.

## Contribute
`TODO`
